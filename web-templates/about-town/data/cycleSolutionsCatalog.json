So yeah, mission accomplished.</p><p>Using their exclusive STRIDE toe-flex technology, the nylon outsole uses a TPU injected forefoot for natural movement off-bike, while still providing a stiffness index of 6.0 for in-the-saddle performance. The Recon 1.0 is a double threat—efficiency at the pedals with comfort and confidence off bike.</p><p>To create traction off the bike in wet or dry, gravel or dirt, we’ve covered the nylon outsole with our SlipNot compound. We’ve also lifted the heel for an even more natural feeling while walking.</p><p>Three Velcro closures make slipping into the Recon 1.0 easy, and creates a fit designed for all day comfort and performance, whether your ride calls for open gravel, twisting single track, and even more than your fair share of hike-a-bike.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Bigger tire clearance for 38mm tires, a super smooth one-by drivetrain, plenty of mounts for racks and fenders—it’s more than just a solid commuter on the road. The Sirrus X is a dialed option when it’s time to get onto the dirt. We equipped this Sirrus X with a 1x Shimano drivetrain to ensure reliable shifting and zero dropped chains, plus next-level comfort that follows our scientifically tested and ergonomically engineered, Shared Platform Body Geometry components. We also equipped it with tubeless-ready tires that nearly eliminate flats and add more comfort and control by allowing for lower tire pressures, as well as our revolutionary Future Shock that takes the sting out of bumps and potholes. So, as you push yourself to reach your goals, you'll feel more connected to your bike and know that you have the perfect partner on your path to health and well being.</p><p>The FACT 9r carbon fiber frame is engineered and designed with our Fitness Geometry, so you'll be able to ride more efficiently and comfortably, no matter the distance. Meanwhile, clearance for 700x38mm tires and the Future Shock \"suspension\" system at the cockpit delivers a revolutionary degree of comfort and control.</p><p>The best part of the Sirrus? The Future Shock. It’s a piston in the head tube with 20mm of travel, so you get better vertical compliance and improved smoothness, speed, and comfort in one fell swoop</p><p>Body Geometry touch points take the sting out of riding with their ergonomically designed, scientifically tested shapes. These touch points are a part of our Shared Platform equipment meaning that based on Retül data, Specialized chose saddle and bar widths based on data, not gender.</p><p>The lightweight FACT carbon fiber fork provides a smooth, responsive ride, while the Plug + Play fender mounts give you the option to install rain-fighting fenders.</p><p>Pathfinder Pro tires are 38mm-wide and 2Bliss Ready, so you get all the ride benefits of wider tires run at lower pressures and significantly less flats. Tubeless tape and valves are included.</p><p></p>",

This means that the inner core is thicker than your average grip in order to deal with shock, while the outer part has a softer density to better absorb vibrations. And to put the \"grip\" into these grips, we also gave them a textured pattern for no-slip performance on the trail. The version found here also has a secure, locking design that's all but guaranteed to stay put when the trail gets rough, plus a thicker diameter for an even plusher feel at the bars. Put it all together, and you're looking at grips that are going to leave your hands comfortable and fresh over your whole ride.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The Dolphin 32 is the smaller version of the Dolphin 48, but with the same eye to quality and function - a top loader with sewn and taped seam technology that offers an Interloc® System that creates a watertight seal by folding the closures one over the other. Then it's roll, clip and go. An open access storage pouch that features small laser cut holes at the bottom for drainage - eliminating need to store wet items inside the bag, doing away with water build up and condensation. &nbsp;Superior accessibility and the best in dry-bag technology has finally arrived.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rolled top closure for maximum weather protection<br>Position: Front or Rear<br>Weight: 1.8g / 3.9 lbs (pair)<br>Volume: 32 l. / 1950 cu. in.

    "description": "<p>\n <video controls=\"controls\" width=\"688\" height=\"344\"> \n  <source src=\"https://cdn.shoplightspeed.com/shops/622502/files/17829716/how-angi-works.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n </video></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Specialized set out to improve the original S-Works Prevail, they knew that they had their work cut out for them. How could they improve on the industry benchmark for fit, ventilation, and comfort? By listening to our riders—that’s how. Through this, they realized that there were a few aspects of the original Prevail II that needed to be changed, with the biggest request being for a lower-sitting design.</p><p>Specialized's new ANGi Crash Sensor gives you and your loved ones peace of mind like never before. When combined with our iOS or Android app, the sensor will detect a crash and send a text message to specified contacts in your phone. It also syncs with our app and STRAVA® to provide GPS-based activity tracking.</p><p>Specialized teamed up with MIPS researchers to introduce MIPS SL—a new, ultra-light, and supremely comfortable version of MIPS that's available exclusively on Specialized helmets. With MIPS SL, they've essentially integrated MIPS technology within the helmet padding itself. MIPS SL's minimalist \"watchband\" attachment system provides 10 to 15 millimeters of rotation in every direction and offers the same brain protection benefits as other versions of MIPS, while also ushering in a new level of comfort and weight savings.</p><p>Specialized thought to themselves, \"thinking big shouldn't result in bigger helmets,\" so with the Prevail, they set out to prove that big ideas can come in smaller packages. It all starts with their patented EPS construction that relies on multi-density foam that's paired with a robotically woven, Aramid-reinforced skeleton. This comes with a reduction in the overall size, creating a smaller profile that fits lower down on the head for a better fit and safety.</p><p>It also has deep internal channels that are aligned from front-to-rear, so the air intake and exhaust are optimized for unparalleled cooling over the entire head. And in the Win Tunnel, Specialized found these new designs amounted to six seconds saved over 40km when compared to a \"standard\" road helmet. Another standout feature of the S-Works Prevail II is the Gutter Action System that manages the flow of sweat, keeping it away from your eyes and dripping it off of the pads over your temple.</p><p>In the end, the S-Works Prevail II is the most complete lightweight race helmet we've ever made—perfect for hot, mountainous rides and flat, windy sections alike.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

With no pedals or gears, it's designed to help your little girl find her balance by making it as easy as possible to put her feet down. In fact, scooting around with her feet is how the bike moves (outside of gravity), so she'll get used to the feeling of riding without much of the risk. Even better for you, there isn't much that can break should the bike hit the deck on the pump track, so there's less maintenance then with a \"traditional\" bike. That's right, you get parental hero status, and they have the time of their lives while they're learning to ride. Win-win.</p><p>Durable and tough, the A1 Premium Aluminum walking frame is designed specifically for little ones to scoot around safely.</p><p>A Hi-Ten steel fork is strong and durable, so it will withstand your little ones trying to catch air for the first time.</p>",

As a result, you get a jersey that'll be long lasting and quite comfortable over the long haul.</p><p>Specialize also included a half-length front zipper, which is one of many points that differentiate it within the RBX line, as well as their Relaxed Fit.

    "description": "<p>With seven wins at Paris-Roubaix, the Roubaix has proven that Smoother is Faster. Until this moment, however, smooth has admittedly come with some compromises. But not anymore. The all-new Roubaix now delivers compliance without compromise by introducing a radical new Future Shock 1.5 that gives you more control on rough roads, a new Pavé seatpost that creates the most balanced Roubaix to date, aerodynamics that equal the Tarmac, and a Rider-First Engineered™ frame that's shed some serious weight. Is it still comfortable? Sure, but don't call it a comfort bike, because performance was behind every engineering decision they made. This is the new Roubaix.</p><p>This Roubaix provides a tremendous value, but like the frame itself, this value doesn't come with any compromises. They spec'd it with Shimano's Tiagra 10-speed group for its crisp shifts and powerful hydraulic disc brakes, as well as reliable Axis Sport Disc wheels, a Praxis Alba crankset, the all-new S-Works Pavé seatpost, 28mm Espoir Sport tires, and their fan-favorite Power Sport saddle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Then again, you don't want to be stuck wearing a full-face on every trail ride. This is why Specialized created the Ambush Comp with ANGi—a lightweight, extended coverage helmet at a wallet-friendly price.</p><p>Starting with protection, the Ambush Comp boasts a significant amount of extended coverage and a single density foam that's been reinforced by a Composite Matrix. The reason behind this is that it manages the energy from impacts more effectively. Even with the added protection, though, it fits comfortably with Specialized low profile and fully integrated Mindset 360 fit system. And with its five height positions, this system provides unmatched adjustment, while an integrated dial allows for on-the-fly fine-tuning. The Ambush Comp also keeps you cool with our 4th Dimension Cooling System's massive vents and exhaust ports, so you don't have to worry about overheating—even on the hottest days.</p><p>Specialized's new ANGi Crash Sensor gives you and your loved ones peace of mind like never before—when combined with our iOS or Android app, the sensor will detect a crash and send a text message to specified contacts in your phone. It also syncs with our app and STRAVA® to provide GPS-based activity tracking.</p><p>Finally, Specialized included a micro-indexing visor that quickly adjusts positions and has plenty of room for goggle storage. Combined, these features put the Ambush Comp well in front of the competition.</p>",

Until this moment, however, smooth has admittedly come with some compromises. But not anymore. The all-new Roubaix Sport now delivers compliance without compromise by introducing a radical new Future Shock 1.5 that gives you more control on rough roads, a new Pavé seatpost that creates our most balanced Roubaix to date, aerodynamics that equal the Tarmac, and a Rider-First Engineered™ frame that's shed some serious weight. Is it still comfortable? Sure, but don't call it a comfort bike, because performance was behind every engineering decision Specialized made. This is the new Roubaix.</p><p>This Roubaix Sport provides a tremendous value, but like the frame itself, this value doesn't come with any compromises. Specialized spec'd it with Shimano's 105 11-speed groupset for its crisp shifts and powerful hydraulic disc brakes, as well as smooth and sturdy DT R470 Disc wheels, the all-new S-Works Pavé seatpost, 28mm Turbo Pro tires, and the fan-favorite Power Sport saddle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Don’t let the step-thru design throw you – it’s all part of the Scene’s laid-back personality, offering casual convenience for all – especially when hauling heavy loads like kids’ seats and trail-a-bikes. Not one to be typecast, the Scene is perfect for family rides, cruising with the crew, or quick trips to refill a growler. And with inspiration from Norco mountain bikes – such as 1by drivetrains and 650B wheels with large volume tires – the Scene is a real showstopper</p>",

Thanks to a clever component selection, the Turbo Levo SL Comp brings all of that rad down to an equally-rad price point.</p><p>It’s You, Just Going Faster and Farther.</p><p>The Turbo Levo SL is effectively a Stumpjumper that lets you embark on ridiculously long adventures with no fear of bonking and helps you snag three laps of your favorite trail instead of just one. Looking for a ton of power and range? Check out our Turbo Levo and Kenevo models. Want a bike, on the other hand, that simply feels like you—a faster you, with the power to ride more trails, kind of you? That's Turbo Levo SL.</p><p>Tune it to Your Style.</p><p>By connecting with Specialized Mission Control App, you can tune the SL 1.1 motor to your riding style, record rides, and monitor the battery. The motor even has a built-in power meter that transmits to any ANT+ head unit. Don't want to connect? No worries—the simple Turbo Connect Unit (TCU) on the top tube gives you all the control you need to just climb on and ride all day.</p><p>• Lightweight, alloy Stumpjumper - inspired frame is pure ride quality and control.</p><p>• Ultra-smooth and lightweight SL 1.1 motor doubles your pedaling power.</p><p>• 150mm of suspension front and rear, courtesy of FOX's 34 fork and DPS shock.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "<p>Let's get something clear—the Stumpjumper EVO Comp Alloy 27.5 isn't a \"normal\" trail bike. It's built to get gnarly, and there's no real way around that. It has a slacked-out front-end and a longer top tube, so the EVO has heavier steering, exceptional front-end traction, and it begs you to boost every lip and do cutties as often as possible. And with the flick-ability that 27.5-inch wheels are known for, you can add-in even more steeze.</p><p>What exactly is \"EVO\" for? EVO is for the shredders—the gnarliest trail riders who live for gravity riding. Big drops, huge kickers, rocks, roots—whatever you throw at it, the Stumpjumper EVO can handle it. EVO uses the same style-specific sizing that's featured on the Demo. This sizing lets you choose the bike that fits the way you ride—not just by the seat tube measurement like with most bikes—and it narrows things down to two sizes, S2 and S3. These are longer, lower, slacker, and have seat tube and head tube heights that allow you to choose the size that best suits your style and terrain.</p><p>The build here keeps the \"EVO\" theme going, with ready-to-shred parts like a FOX DPX2 rear shock (150mm of travel), FOX Rhythm 36 fork (150mm of travel), SRAM Code R brakes, and Roval Traverse 27.5 alloy wheels. And when you top it off with SRAM's NX Eagle drivetrain, you'll have no problem getting it to the top of the runs, either.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

With our lives getting more hectic with each passing day, finding the tiny pockets of time savings can have a huge impact, and the Turbo Vado 5.0 truly embodies this concept. It utilizes our most advanced pedal-assist technologies, a high-quality component spec, and a suspension fork to take the edge out of those pesky potholes. No matter where you're going, you'll get there faster and in style with the Turbo Vado 5.0.</p><p>Beginning with the integrated Specialized 1.3 motor, it has a higher max torque, max watts, and better heat management and efficiency than its predecessors. It's the most advanced motor ever found on an urban e-bike. Of course, it still features a silent operating design with our Custom Rx Street Tune that takes the output and makes it the most usable for an urban environment. Think of it this way: The more power you put out, the more power the motor puts out, and this makes accelerations from a standstill both quick and efficient. The belt driven motor is also smooth, silent, and free of annoying vibrations.</p><p>For the Vado 5.0, Specialized developed a custom 600 Wh battery that seamlessly integrates into the frame, is lockable, and easily removable for simplified charging. In other words, there's plenty of juice to take you to and from work, a trip to the grocery store, or even to that new café on the other side of the city. If you wish to see exactly how far you can go on a charge, have a look at Specialized's Turbo Range Calculator for more exact estimates.</p><p>The new wired Turbo Connect Display (TCD-w) is the best way to view data on your Turbo. It not only displays important ride metrics (speed, cadence, rider power, distance, battery level, time, etc.), it also allows you to connect the latest version of the Mission Control App for an enhanced Turbo experience. With Specialized free app for iOS and Android phones, you easily customize motor parameters, control your range, record/upload rides, and perform basic system diagnosis.</p><p>And to top off all of the innovative features, we chose a high-end spec with Shimano XT/SLX 11-speed components, four-piston hydraulic disc brakes, an SR SunTour fork with 50mm of travel, integrated front/rear lights, and mounts for fenders and racks. It's ready to take on the town in effortless style.</p><p><span style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; display: inline !important; float: none;\">For further information on what is and isn't allowed in regards to E-bikes in Ontario please </span><a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: #cc3232; text-decoration: none; transition: color 0.3s ease-in-out 0s; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" href=\"http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/driver/electric-bicycles-faq.shtml\">click here</a></p>",

Since 1994, when Wet Lube was first introduced, it has become the preferred lubricant for many professional on and off-road teams around the world.</p><p>Use Wet Lube when you ride hard and long. Proven performance for 100-plus mile rides, muddy off-road conditions, long rainy commutes, and foggy salt-air coastal climates. A heavier, wet-style lubricant that requires a little more attention to drivetrain cleanliness, but delivers the ultimate in lubricity and protection.</p>",

These bearings have 35-40% more load capacity than standard radial bearings. Enduro accomplishes this with a special design where the maximum number of balls are inserted into the bearing. The race grooves are deeper on these bearings for more lateral support for the twisting and multiple forces associated with mountain bike pivots. LLU seals give maximum protection against the elements, while keeping the 90% fill of Almagard Extra High Pressure Grease inside.</p><p>*Image may not represent actual product</p>",

The result is a bike that puts plenty of high-dollar eMTBs to shame.</p><p>ROWDY DESCENTS. STEEP CLIMBS? HELL. YES.</p><p>The Turbo Levo is a fully-fledged progressive trail bike. They have lengthened the reach, kept the chainstays nice and short, and maintained a low center of gravity.

What’s more, our Mission Control App can handle battery management automatically, ensuring your battery will last as long as you need it to. More power. More miles per ride.

    "description": "<p>EVO represents the rowdier side of our bike line and the Epic Comp EVO is no exception to the rule. Specialized added a longer travel fork and a dropper post to the Comp-level Epic to create a bike that’s just as fast, but offers even more control when the trail gets hectic.</p><p>A MORE EPIC KIND OF EPIC</p><p>Dropper posts and slightly longer forks may seem like overkill on an XC bike. We beg to differ. Epic EVOs are not only fast off the start line, they're even better suited to masochistically long rides, multi-day stage races, and fast backcountry missions.</p><p>HARDTAIL EFFICIENT. FULL-SUSPENSION CONTROL</p><p>Suspension should always make you faster—never slow you down with energy-sucking suspension bob. Our ingenious Brain-equipped shocks keep the Epic firm when the trail is smooth, then automatically turns your bike plush the moment your tires meet rocks and roots.</p><p>• Race-proven, alloy chassis and ingenious Brain suspension.</p><p>• 120mm-travel RockShox Reba RL fork increases the EVO’s downhill capability.</p><p>• An X-Fusion Manic dropper seatpost increases control on steep descents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Essentially, this forms a glass-like finish that provides a totally natural, and completely inert, solution to the problem of your drinks staining the bottle or leaving behind any residual aftertaste. This infusion also shields your fresh water from tasting like plastic on very hot days, making it akin to drinking straight from a sparkling clean glass.</p><p>And with our MoFlo cap, it's easy to open, effortless to use, and leak-proof when closed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The next generation Electrak 2.0 tread has GRIPTON compound and grooves for ultimate grip and performance when the weather turns foul. It's also an excellent choice to install on 29-inch mountain bikes that get plenty of time on city streets and the open road. Lastly, its reflective accents will increase your visibility to motorists in low-light conditions.</p>",

With plenty of pockets and storage capacity,&nbsp;this waterproof bag will easily carry all your office gear and more. As with all Arkel panniers, the Metropolitan comes equipped with our patented&nbsp;<a title=\"Link to Cam-Lock mounting system info page\" href=\"https://www.arkel-od.com/useful-03-attachment/\">Cam-Lock mounting&nbsp;system</a>. Whatever road conditions, you can ride in confidence that your pannier will stay attached to the rack. That’s a nice feeling, especially when carrying an&nbsp;expensive laptop. This bag has a rolltop closure system but we also added a zipper at the end of the opening.&nbsp;This means, if you stop for a run of groceries, you’ll be able to leave the bag unrolled and simply use the top zipper closure to keep everything secure. This feature almost doubles the bag’s volume! Another great feature of this bag is the easy grab and go pocket located between the front pocket and the main compartment. This open pocket will quickly become your favorite&nbsp;place to store any small items that need to stay close at hand. The flat bottom keeps the bag upright&nbsp;when resting on the floor.</p><p>This bag is built to last with tough 1000 denier&nbsp;Cordura® fabric. To make this pannier 100% waterproof, we use a&nbsp;TPU laminated internal nylon liner with fully taped seams.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The new Stumpjumper ST uses new tube shapes and an asymmetrical design to ensure that you get awesome ride characteristics. So get ready, because the Stumpjumper ST Alloy 29 is sure to exceed your expectations of how a trail bike should ride.</p><p>Specialized design goal for the new Stumpjumper was simple—build the ultimate trail bike, one that feels telepathic. And it turns out that this feeling all comes down to stiffness. Think of it this way: when the frame's telling your hands one thing and your feet another, your brain gets confused with the imbalance and the bike feels unstable. In order to fix this, Specialized had to get to work on dialing-in the materials and shapes.</p><p>Specialized continued down the suspension path with a custom Rx Trail Tune on both the fork and rear shock. Suspension performance is highly dependent on frame, wheel, and rider size, so Rx Tune is used to get each bike to land in the middle of the adjustment spectrum, and this gives you the biggest possible range to fine-tune your ride. Another focal point of the tune was matching the suspension characteristics between wheel sizes—Specialized developed a specific Rx Tune for each platform. So, no matter what wheel size you prefer, you'll get perfectly linear suspension.</p><p>Steps were also taken to make this bike easy to live with. Threaded bottom brackets make a triumphant return, and there is room for up to a 3.0' tire. You're also free to run whatever aftermarket rear shock you want, since there are standard metric shocks. And customization is furthered with a Flip Chip that lets you to dial-in your Stumpy to your riding style. Switch it from High to Low and it drops your bottom bracket 6mm and slackens the head tube by half-a-degree. Little details also jump out to surprise you, like a newly designed ribbed chainstay protector that makes chain slap a thing of the past and nearly silences the drivetrain.</p><p>The build here is no-nonsense with a focus on dependable, high-performing parts, like Shimano SLX front and rear derailleurs, Tektro Gemini disc brakes, a RockShox Recon RL fork with 130mm of travel, a custom X-Fusion 02 Pro RL rear shock with 120mm of travel, and wide alloy wheels.</p><p>The all-new alloy Stumpjumper ST frame features an M5 alloy front- and rear-end, an asymmetrical design, and 29 Trail Geometry, so it's both capable and comfortable.</p><p>The X-Fusion Metric rear shock features rebound adjustment, lockout, and the coveted Rx Trail Tune to ensure you're getting the most out of your Stumpjumper ST.</p><p>A RockShox Recon RL provides 130mm of travel up front, and it lets you adjust both rebound and lockout.</p><p></p>",

Essentially, this forms a glass-like finish that provides a totally natural, and completely inert, solution to the problem of your drinks staining the bottle or leaving behind any residual aftertaste. This infusion also shields your fresh water from tasting like plastic on very hot days, making it akin to drinking straight from a sparkling clean glass.</p><p>The silicon dioxide coating is a mere 20 nanometers thick which, for comparison, is less than 5,000 times thinner than a human hair. Meanwhile, the shape of the bottle feels equally perfect both in the hand and in the cage.</p><p>It comes equipped with the MoFlo Water Bottle Cap, which delivers 50% more water than other traditional caps. The MoFlo valve is also easy to open, effortless to use, and 100% leak-proof when closed.</p><p>Purist infusion shields the bottle form odor, stains, and mold to keep your water pure and your bottle clean.</p><p>Large screw top design is leak-free and wide enough for ice cubes&nbsp;and scooping in powdered drink mix.</p><p>New MoFlo™ cap design features a wide water channel to deliver up to 50%&nbsp;greater flow than other leading bottles, plus it has&nbsp;improved functional grip.</p><p>Made from easy-to-squeeze LDPE material.</p><p>Clear viewing strip makes it easy to see the bottle's contents.</p><p>BPA-Free plastic is made from 100%&nbsp;FDA food-grade materials, and it's printed with non-solvent&nbsp;base (UV Cured), CPSC-approved ink and materials.</p><p>Available in 22oz and 26oz Purist Bottles.</p>",

As with all Arkel panniers, the Metropolitan comes equipped with our patented&nbsp;<a title=\"Link to Cam-Lock mounting system info page\" href=\"https://www.arkel-od.com/useful-03-attachment/\">Cam-Lock mounting&nbsp;system</a>. Whatever road conditions, you can ride in confidence that your pannier will stay attached to the rack. That’s a nice feeling, especially when carrying an&nbsp;expensive laptop. This bag has a rolltop closure system but we also added a zipper at the end of the opening.&nbsp;This means, if you stop for a run of groceries, you’ll be able to leave the bag unrolled and simply use the top zipper closure to keep everything secure. This feature almost doubles the bag’s volume! Another great feature of this bag is the easy grab and go pocket located between the front pocket and the main compartment. This open pocket will quickly become your favorite&nbsp;place to store any small items that need to stay close at hand. The flat bottom keeps the bag upright&nbsp;when resting on the floor.</p><p>This bag is built to last with tough 1000 denier&nbsp;Cordura® fabric. To make this pannier 100% waterproof, we use a&nbsp;TPU laminated internal nylon liner with fully taped seams.</p>",

Lighter weight than Specialized's standard Therminal Warmer collection, this seamless version is perfect to stash in a jersey pocket when you need a little extra protection on a fast descent or for a long climb in the shadows.</p><p>They used a yarn that offers good loft for trapping body heat and adding a good sense of durability, while a knit construction allows for excellent air permeability and breathability. This technique and design also comes with the added benefit of aligning with your knee, so the warmers will stay put with just the right amount of compression at the cuffs.</p><p>Therminal fabrics feature a brushed fleece interior that insulates, while remaining highly breathable and effective at managing moisture.</p><p>Engineered construction minimizes edges and stitching, creating a smooth, compressive feel against your skin.</p><p>Knitted articualtion and openings keep the warmers in place for the perfect fit.</p><p>Deflect™ UV 50+ protects your skin from harmful ultraviolet rays.</p>",

Arkel's welded seam technology ensures that the bag will stay dry no matter the conditions you ride in and the patented Cam-Lock® mounting system will keep the bags on the rack, regardless of the load or road conditions. No one else offers such a solid and reliable mounting system for bike panniers. Many smaller details make this bag unique, an internal organizer for easy access to documents, maps, tablet, wallet, etc. This means you won’t have to empty half the bag to reach these. A plastic protector at the bottom backside of the pannier adds protection between the bag and the rack and will avoid any premature wear caused by friction against the rack. Arkel also added D-rings for an&nbsp;optional shoulder strap.&nbsp;This is very practical when travelling at the airport or simply carrying your panniers around at the end of a long ride. Many small details make these panniers functional, durable and most importantly fun to use.</p><p>Fully Waterproof RF welded seams.</p><p>Patented Cam-Lock® mounting system.</p><p>Front exterior zippered pocket.</p><p>Internal organizer for important papers, tablet, etc...</p><p>Tabs to mount blinker lights.</p><p>Reflective material on all sides.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Roll top waterproof pannier for 100% waterproof protection<br><strong>Position</strong>: Rear<br><strong>Weight</strong>: 2.16 kg / 4.8 lbs (pair)<br><strong>Volume</strong>: 48 l. / 2930 cu. in.

In fact, it’s the first device to protect you before, during, and after a crash. It does this through a pairing with our Specialized Ride App for iOS or Android devices. And if it detects a crash, it commences a countdown that, if you’re ok, you can stop and keep riding. If, however, ANGi determines that you’re in need of help, it’ll send an alert to your selected contacts with your last known GPS coordinates and a message that you’re in need of help. What about if you’re out of service coverage? ANGi has a plan for that. Just set your estimated ride time before you head out when you know that your ride will take you out of range. All you need is an active data signal when you start your session. And if you haven’t completed your ride within that time frame, ANGi will send a notification to your contacts with your last uploaded location.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

A core stalwart of the collection, the MT500 II Neoprene Overshoe has been a best-seller for many years. Endura knows a thing or two about foul weather gear and this waterproof durable overshoe is the result of years of testing in the worst possible conditions. Endura’s unique moulded rubber toe cap with a ridged underside provides grip when climbing steep and muddy slopes. <br><br></p><p><strong>Waterproof</strong></p><p>Durable faced neoprene outer fabric provides total waterproofing from above, keeping your feet warm and dry inside. A durable sole with cleat access points stitched with a bulletproof aramid thread extends the lifespan beyond other more flimsy alternatives on the market. <br><br></p><p><strong>Functional Detail</strong></p><p>The overshoe zipper is covered by neoprene which butts together at the rear and improves water tightness. A snug fit is guaranteed with the Velcro® heel tab. <br><br></p><p><strong>Finish Detail</strong></p><p>There is a reflective detail print to help keep you safe. <br><br></p><p><strong>Fit</strong></p><p>This product is in a standard fit suitable for wearing over all MTB cleated shoes.</p>",

The 1.2 E uses the same hardware as our 1.2 motor, but it features a tune that prioritizes efficiency. This means less peak torque and maximum output. Of course, it still features a near-silent operating design with our Custom Rx Street Tune that takes the output and makes it the most usable for an urban environment. Think of it this way: The more power you put out, the more power the motor puts out, and this makes accelerations from a standstill at, say, a traffic light both quick and efficient. The belt driven motor is also smooth, silent, and free of annoying vibrations. And the max speed? 28mph.</p><p>For the Vado 3.0, we developed a custom Specialized U1-460 battery that seamlessly integrates into the frame, is lockable, and easily removable for simplified charging. In other words, there's plenty of juice to take you to and from work, a trip to the grocery store, or even to that new café on the other side of the city. If you wish to see exactly how far you can go on a charge, have a look at Specialized's Turbo Range Calculator for more exact estimates.</p><p>The new Turbo Connect Display (TCD) is the best way to view data on your Turbo. It not only displays basic ride metrics (speed, cadence, power, battery level, and time), but it also lets you toggle between modes. Its design, meanwhile, is rugged and clean, and it has multiple mounting options for either road or mountain setups. As for the latest version of the Mission Control App, you’ll find that it now has more features and is even more intuitive to use. It lets you custom-tune nearly every aspect of the bike with ease, monitor your power usage, control your range, perform basic system diagnoses, and record/upload rides.</p><p>To top off all of the innovative features, we chose a worry-free spec that features Shimano 9-speed components, hydraulic disc brakes, front/rear lights, and fender &amp; rack mounts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Turbo Vado features a lightweight alloy frame that’s been designed with Fitness/Transportation Geometry.</p><p>The Turbo Vado’s Specialized 1.2 E motor emphasizes efficiency and range. They also fully integrated it with the frame, and it's been custom-tuned for city riding. It intuitively reacts to the force of your pedaling, so the harder you pedal, the more power it delivers. And with an internal belt drive design, it does this without added vibration for the smoothest and most silent ride possible.</p><p>Specialized made the custom 460 Wh battery to be fully integrated with the frame, removable for easy charging, and lockable for added security. It communicates with the display and has multiple modes to maximize the overall efficiency and range. For range estimates based upon a variety of variables, please refer to Specialized's Turbo Range Calculator.</p><p>Canada Maximum motor speed: 20 mph / 32 km/h</p><p><span style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; display: inline !important; float: none;\">For further information on what is and isn't allowed in regards to E-bikes in Ontario please </span><a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: #cc3232; text-decoration: none; transition: color 0.3s ease-in-out 0s; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" href=\"http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/driver/electric-bicycles-faq.shtml\">click here</a></p>",

    "description": "<p>Finish Line began innovating chain cleaners back in 1988 when its patented rotating brush design set the standard. For the first time a bicycle chain could be thoroughly cleaned in a minute or two without taking it off the bike. Quick, efficient and easy to use.</p><p></p><p>Since 1988 Finish Line has innovated two new generations of chain cleaners. The new third generation chain cleaner has once again redefined the way bicycle chains are being cleaned, both in shops and at home.</p><p>Finish Line's proprietary rotating brushes are still utilized in the third generation unit. However, the exit angle has been changed from 90 degrees to 47 degrees, which virtually eliminates drips and spills. An additional row of scrapper pads have been added for enhanced side-plate cleaning. A large magnet has been added to attract and hold magnetized wear particles and is located at the bottom of the chain cleaner. New shop quality plastic prevents shattering when dropped.</p><p>For cyclists who are serious about keeping their drivetrain in race-ready condition, Finish Line's Pro Chain Cleaner is a valuable piece of equipment that will make this tedious task much easier.</p><p>Use once or twice a month to maximize your bicycle's chain life and enjoy a cleaner, smoother, and more efficient drivetrain.</p>",

Those new or old to the sport will be amazed at what a dramatic difference the correct fit can make when it comes to comfort, performance and overall enjoyment of cycling.</p><p>Spring has almost sprung, and it’s almost time to start adding distance to your training rides. Most people look forward to a season full of long days in the saddle. But nagging aches or pains can suck the enjoyment right out of cycling and turn a long ride into a REALLY long ride. Life’s far too short for that nonsense – particularly since most cycling discomfort is easily eliminated through proper bike fit. For most people, this requires the help of a professional.</p><p>Bikes come in a limited number of shapes and sizes. Cyclists do not. Bike manufacturers use adjustable components so their bikes can be made to accommodate a larger cross-section of riders. A trained bike fitter knows which adjustments need to be made to each of these components so that human and machine can truly become one.</p><p>cleat adjustment &nbsp;</p><p>seat fore and aft adjustment</p><p>seat height adjustment</p><p>bar angle adjustment</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

By directly connecting all three mounting points of the rear-end and shock to the frame, we've increased both stiffness and performance over bumps.</p><p>PERFECTLY-BALANCED SUSPENSION</p><p>Our in-house suspension-tuning team develops custom shock tunes, perfectly paired to each bike's kinematics. They call this Rx Tune and while it's not the easy way to build a suspension bike, it's worth it. You feel Rx Tune as perfectly-balanced suspension. It's total control.</p><p>MASSIVE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK</p><p>• RockShox 35 Gold RL fork and Deluxe Select shock erase rocks and roots.</p><p>• SX Eagle 12-speed drivetrain gives you single-ring simplicity and gearing to spare.</p><p>• Roval Traverse 29er wheels roll over obstacles and maintain momentum with ease.</p>",

Finally, there's a vulcanized rubber sole with molded tread for off-the bike grip, traction and durability. Reflective trims keep you visiable to drivers in low light conditions.</p><p>Insulating and waterproof neoprene features an interior and exterior nylon knit that helps repel water and stretches to conform to any shoe, including ones with dial adjusters.</p><p>Heat taping seals up stitch holes for less water infiltration and provides added seam durability.</p><p>YKK AquaGuard® water-repellant rear zippers seal out water and provide easy entry and exit.</p><p>Vulcanized rubber outsole is attached without stitching, eliminating water intrusion points and provides sure-footed traction.</p><p>Universal cleat opening means that the covers are compatible with all cleat styles, but they're specifically for road shoes.</p><p>Reflective elements increase your visibility to motorists and other riders in low-light conditions.</p>",

Their welded seam technology ensures that the bag will stay dry no matter the conditions you ride in and the patented Cam-Lock® mounting system will keep the bags on the rack, regardless of the load or road conditions. No one else offers such a solid and reliable mounting system for bike panniers. Many smaller details make this bag unique, an internal organizer for easy access to documents, maps, tablet, wallet, etc. This means you won’t have to empty half the bag to reach these. A plastic protector at the bottom backside of the pannier adds protection between the bag and the rack and will avoid any premature wear caused by friction against the rack. Arkel also added D-rings for an&nbsp;optional shoulder strap, This is very practical when travelling at the airport or simply carrying your panniers around at the end of a long ride. Many small details make these panniers functional, durable and most importantly fun to use.</p><p>Fully Waterproof RF welded seams.</p><p>Patented Cam-Lock® mounting system.</p><p>Front exterior zippered pocket.</p><p>Internal organizer for important papers, tablet, etc...</p><p>Tabs to mount blinker lights.</p><p>Reflective material on all sides.</p><p>Will fit front or rear racks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Front or Rear<br><strong>Weight</strong>: 1.86 kg / 4.1 lbs (pair)&nbsp;without&nbsp;removable internal cradle&nbsp;- 2.12kg / 4.6 lbs (pair)&nbsp;with&nbsp;removable internal cradle<br><strong>Volume</strong>: 35 l. / 2140 cu. in.

The security and control that the wheel system, found on the Fatboy SE, provides is unparalleled. You get dramatically more traction, grip, and floatation than with traditional mountain tires, all without sacrificing much to climbing efficiency.</p><p>The end result is easy to explain—you have way more fun. And to make sure of it, Specialized built the Fatboy with a durable, no-nonsense list of components that are low-maintenance and eager to perform season after season.</p><p>The frame features an M5 alloy construction that provides the ideal blend of efficiency and durability, while the geometry creates a roomy top tube and short chainstays for easy climbing and confident descending.</p><p>The alloy fork with air-formed legs is lightweight and pairs up perfectly with the fat wheel system to soak up trail chatter and bumps.</p><p>The Shimano 10-speed groupset features a wide gear range that delivers climbing and descending efficiency in spades. On top of this, the one-by setup is notorious for being next to impossible to drop a chain with, plus it provides a significant weight savings in comparison to a standard two-by setup.</p>",

Those new or old to the sport will be amazed at what a dramatic difference the correct fit can make when it comes to comfort, performance and overall enjoyment of cycling.</p><p>Nagging aches or pains can suck the enjoyment right out of cycling and turn a long ride into a REALLY long ride. Life’s far too short for that nonsense – particularly since most cycling discomfort is easily eliminated through proper bike fit. For most people, this requires the help of a professional.</p><p>Bikes come in a limited number of shapes and sizes. Cyclists do not. Bike manufacturers use adjustable components so their bikes can be made to accommodate a larger cross-section of riders. A trained bike fitter knows which adjustments need to be made to each of these components so that human and machine can truly become one.</p><p>seat fore and aft adjustment</p><p>seat height adjustment</p><p>bar angle adjustment</p>",
