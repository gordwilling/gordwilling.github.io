So yeah, mission accomplished.</p><p>Using their exclusive STRIDE toe-flex technology, the nylon outsole uses a TPU injected forefoot for natural movement off-bike, while still providing a stiffness index of 6.0 for in-the-saddle performance. The Recon 1.0 is a double threat—efficiency at the pedals with comfort and confidence off bike.</p><p>To create traction off the bike in wet or dry, gravel or dirt, we’ve covered the nylon outsole with our SlipNot compound. We’ve also lifted the heel for an even more natural feeling while walking.</p><p>Three Velcro closures make slipping into the Recon 1.0 easy, and creates a fit designed for all day comfort and performance, whether your ride calls for open gravel, twisting single track, and even more than your fair share of hike-a-bike.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Bigger tire clearance for 38mm tires, a super smooth one-by drivetrain, plenty of mounts for racks and fenders—it’s more than just a solid commuter on the road. The Sirrus X is a dialed option when it’s time to get onto the dirt. We equipped this Sirrus X with a 1x Shimano drivetrain to ensure reliable shifting and zero dropped chains, plus next-level comfort that follows our scientifically tested and ergonomically engineered, Shared Platform Body Geometry components. We also equipped it with tubeless-ready tires that nearly eliminate flats and add more comfort and control by allowing for lower tire pressures, as well as our revolutionary Future Shock that takes the sting out of bumps and potholes. So, as you push yourself to reach your goals, you'll feel more connected to your bike and know that you have the perfect partner on your path to health and well being.</p><p>The FACT 9r carbon fiber frame is engineered and designed with our Fitness Geometry, so you'll be able to ride more efficiently and comfortably, no matter the distance. Meanwhile, clearance for 700x38mm tires and the Future Shock \"suspension\" system at the cockpit delivers a revolutionary degree of comfort and control.</p><p>The best part of the Sirrus? The Future Shock. It’s a piston in the head tube with 20mm of travel, so you get better vertical compliance and improved smoothness, speed, and comfort in one fell swoop</p><p>Body Geometry touch points take the sting out of riding with their ergonomically designed, scientifically tested shapes. These touch points are a part of our Shared Platform equipment meaning that based on Retül data, Specialized chose saddle and bar widths based on data, not gender.</p><p>The lightweight FACT carbon fiber fork provides a smooth, responsive ride, while the Plug + Play fender mounts give you the option to install rain-fighting fenders.</p><p>Pathfinder Pro tires are 38mm-wide and 2Bliss Ready, so you get all the ride benefits of wider tires run at lower pressures and significantly less flats. Tubeless tape and valves are included.</p><p></p>",

This means that the inner core is thicker than your average grip in order to deal with shock, while the outer part has a softer density to better absorb vibrations. And to put the \"grip\" into these grips, we also gave them a textured pattern for no-slip performance on the trail. The version found here also has a secure, locking design that's all but guaranteed to stay put when the trail gets rough, plus a thicker diameter for an even plusher feel at the bars. Put it all together, and you're looking at grips that are going to leave your hands comfortable and fresh over your whole ride.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "<p>\n </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Specialized set out to improve the original S-Works Prevail, they knew that they had their work cut out for them. How could they improve on the industry benchmark for fit, ventilation, and comfort? By listening to our riders—that’s how. Through this, they realized that there were a few aspects of the original Prevail II that needed to be changed, with the biggest request being for a lower-sitting design.</p><p>Specialized's new ANGi Crash Sensor gives you and your loved ones peace of mind like never before. When combined with our iOS or Android app, the sensor will detect a crash and send a text message to specified contacts in your phone. It also syncs with our app and STRAVA® to provide GPS-based activity tracking.</p><p>Specialized teamed up with MIPS researchers to introduce MIPS SL—a new, ultra-light, and supremely comfortable version of MIPS that's available exclusively on Specialized helmets. With MIPS SL, they've essentially integrated MIPS technology within the helmet padding itself. MIPS SL's minimalist \"watchband\" attachment system provides 10 to 15 millimeters of rotation in every direction and offers the same brain protection benefits as other versions of MIPS, while also ushering in a new level of comfort and weight savings.</p><p>Specialized thought to themselves, \"thinking big shouldn't result in bigger helmets,\" so with the Prevail, they set out to prove that big ideas can come in smaller packages. It all starts with their patented EPS construction that relies on multi-density foam that's paired with a robotically woven, Aramid-reinforced skeleton. This comes with a reduction in the overall size, creating a smaller profile that fits lower down on the head for a better fit and safety.</p><p>It also has deep internal channels that are aligned from front-to-rear, so the air intake and exhaust are optimized for unparalleled cooling over the entire head. And in the Win Tunnel, Specialized found these new designs amounted to six seconds saved over 40km when compared to a \"standard\" road helmet. Another standout feature of the S-Works Prevail II is the Gutter Action System that manages the flow of sweat, keeping it away from your eyes and dripping it off of the pads over your temple.</p><p>In the end, the S-Works Prevail II is the most complete lightweight race helmet we've ever made—perfect for hot, mountainous rides and flat, windy sections alike.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

With no pedals or gears, it's designed to help your little girl find her balance by making it as easy as possible to put her feet down. In fact, scooting around with her feet is how the bike moves (outside of gravity), so she'll get used to the feeling of riding without much of the risk. Even better for you, there isn't much that can break should the bike hit the deck on the pump track, so there's less maintenance then with a \"traditional\" bike. That's right, you get parental hero status, and they have the time of their lives while they're learning to ride. Win-win.</p><p>Durable and tough, the A1 Premium Aluminum walking frame is designed specifically for little ones to scoot around safely.</p><p>A Hi-Ten steel fork is strong and durable, so it will withstand your little ones trying to catch air for the first time.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Specialized is all for quality, but one thing that they can't will themselves to condone is the superfluous. Sometimes, you just need a jersey that works and works at the right price. Sometimes, you need something like our RBX Jersey.</p><p>It's made from Specialized VaporRize knit fabrics that place a focus on balancing durability and moisture management. As a result, you get a jersey that'll be long lasting and quite comfortable over the long haul.</p><p>Specialize also included a half-length front zipper, which is one of many points that differentiate it within the RBX line, as well as their Relaxed Fit. You'll find that this cut is \"sporty\" enough for long rides, yet it's roomy enough to be more akin to your favorite t-shirt than a painted-on jersey.</p><p>VaporRize knit fabrics place an emphasis on accelerated moisture transfer and evaporation, leaving you dry, cool, and comfortable over long efforts.</p><p>Three expansion pockets expand to provide more than enough room to house all of your ride essentials.</p><p>Half-length front zipper gives just enough ventilation to cool you down on hard climbs.</p><p>Deflect UV 30 protects your skin from harmful ultraviolet rays.</p><p>Relaxed Fit is more akin to a t-shirt than a race jersey—loose, comfortable, and ready for a day out.</p>",

    "description": "<p>With seven wins at Paris-Roubaix, the Roubaix has proven that Smoother is Faster. Until this moment, however, smooth has admittedly come with some compromises. But not anymore. The all-new Roubaix now delivers compliance without compromise by introducing a radical new Future Shock 1.5 that gives you more control on rough roads, a new Pavé seatpost that creates the most balanced Roubaix to date, aerodynamics that equal the Tarmac, and a Rider-First Engineered™ frame that's shed some serious weight. Is it still comfortable? Sure, but don't call it a comfort bike, because performance was behind every engineering decision they made. This is the new Roubaix.</p><p>This Roubaix provides a tremendous value, but like the frame itself, this value doesn't come with any compromises. They spec'd it with Shimano's Tiagra 10-speed group for its crisp shifts and powerful hydraulic disc brakes, as well as reliable Axis Sport Disc wheels, a Praxis Alba crankset, the all-new S-Works Pavé seatpost, 28mm Espoir Sport tires, and their fan-favorite Power Sport saddle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "<p>\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When ripping down the trail, the last thing you need to worry about is if your helmet will protect you in a crash. Then again, you don't want to be stuck wearing a full-face on every trail ride. This is why Specialized created the Ambush Comp with ANGi—a lightweight, extended coverage helmet at a wallet-friendly price.</p><p>Starting with protection, the Ambush Comp boasts a significant amount of extended coverage and a single density foam that's been reinforced by a Composite Matrix. The reason behind this is that it manages the energy from impacts more effectively. Even with the added protection, though, it fits comfortably with Specialized low profile and fully integrated Mindset 360 fit system. And with its five height positions, this system provides unmatched adjustment, while an integrated dial allows for on-the-fly fine-tuning. The Ambush Comp also keeps you cool with our 4th Dimension Cooling System's massive vents and exhaust ports, so you don't have to worry about overheating—even on the hottest days.</p><p>Specialized's new ANGi Crash Sensor gives you and your loved ones peace of mind like never before—when combined with our iOS or Android app, the sensor will detect a crash and send a text message to specified contacts in your phone. It also syncs with our app and STRAVA® to provide GPS-based activity tracking.</p><p>Finally, Specialized included a micro-indexing visor that quickly adjusts positions and has plenty of room for goggle storage. Combined, these features put the Ambush Comp well in front of the competition.</p>",

Until this moment, however, smooth has admittedly come with some compromises. But not anymore. The all-new Roubaix Sport now delivers compliance without compromise by introducing a radical new Future Shock 1.5 that gives you more control on rough roads, a new Pavé seatpost that creates our most balanced Roubaix to date, aerodynamics that equal the Tarmac, and a Rider-First Engineered™ frame that's shed some serious weight. Is it still comfortable? Sure, but don't call it a comfort bike, because performance was behind every engineering decision Specialized made. This is the new Roubaix.</p><p>This Roubaix Sport provides a tremendous value, but like the frame itself, this value doesn't come with any compromises. Specialized spec'd it with Shimano's 105 11-speed groupset for its crisp shifts and powerful hydraulic disc brakes, as well as smooth and sturdy DT R470 Disc wheels, the all-new S-Works Pavé seatpost, 28mm Turbo Pro tires, and the fan-favorite Power Sport saddle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Norco Scene is not another hybrid re-run. Rated ‘R’ for rad, the Scene’s modern spin on the upright, hybrid bike will have you doing a double take. Don’t let the step-thru design throw you – it’s all part of the Scene’s laid-back personality, offering casual convenience for all – especially when hauling heavy loads like kids’ seats and trail-a-bikes. Not one to be typecast, the Scene is perfect for family rides, cruising with the crew, or quick trips to refill a growler. And with inspiration from Norco mountain bikes – such as 1by drivetrains and 650B wheels with large volume tires – the Scene is a real showstopper</p>",

The all-new S-Works Roubaix now delivers compliance without compromise by introducing a radical new Future Shock 2.0 that gives you more control and damping options, a new Pavé seatpost that creates the most balanced Roubaix to date, aerodynamics that equal the Tarmac, and a Rider-First Engineered™ frame that tips the scales below 900 grams (Size: 56cm - Black). Is it still comfortable? Sure, but don't call it a comfort bike, because performance was behind every engineering decision we made.

    "description": "<p>Let's get something clear—the Stumpjumper EVO Comp Alloy 27.5 isn't a \"normal\" trail bike. It's built to get gnarly, and there's no real way around that. It has a slacked-out front-end and a longer top tube, so the EVO has heavier steering, exceptional front-end traction, and it begs you to boost every lip and do cutties as often as possible. And with the flick-ability that 27.5-inch wheels are known for, you can add-in even more steeze.</p><p>What exactly is \"EVO\" for? EVO is for the shredders—the gnarliest trail riders who live for gravity riding. Big drops, huge kickers, rocks, roots—whatever you throw at it, the Stumpjumper EVO can handle it. EVO uses the same style-specific sizing that's featured on the Demo. This sizing lets you choose the bike that fits the way you ride—not just by the seat tube measurement like with most bikes—and it narrows things down to two sizes, S2 and S3. These are longer, lower, slacker, and have seat tube and head tube heights that allow you to choose the size that best suits your style and terrain.</p><p>The build here keeps the \"EVO\" theme going, with ready-to-shred parts like a FOX DPX2 rear shock (150mm of travel), FOX Rhythm 36 fork (150mm of travel), SRAM Code R brakes, and Roval Traverse 27.5 alloy wheels. And when you top it off with SRAM's NX Eagle drivetrain, you'll have no problem getting it to the top of the runs, either.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.financeit.ca/en/direct/payment-plan/cD1HMGUwRjBpU1BqeTlHN25OOVFUZ1pnJnM9MCZ2PTQmZj0mdD0mbD0mYT0yMDkyOTc=/apply\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shoplightspeed.com/shops/622502/files/15580633/finan.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1009\" height=\"140\"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Specialized set out to revamp our Turbo line, they knew that they needed to design a bike that best meets your needs. With our lives getting more hectic with each passing day, finding the tiny pockets of time savings can have a huge impact, and the Turbo Vado 5.0 truly embodies this concept. It utilizes our most advanced pedal-assist technologies, a high-quality component spec, and a suspension fork to take the edge out of those pesky potholes. No matter where you're going, you'll get there faster and in style with the Turbo Vado 5.0.</p><p>Beginning with the integrated Specialized 1.3 motor, it has a higher max torque, max watts, and better heat management and efficiency than its predecessors. It's the most advanced motor ever found on an urban e-bike. Of course, it still features a silent operating design with our Custom Rx Street Tune that takes the output and makes it the most usable for an urban environment. Think of it this way: The more power you put out, the more power the motor puts out, and this makes accelerations from a standstill both quick and efficient. The belt driven motor is also smooth, silent, and free of annoying vibrations.</p><p>For the Vado 5.0, Specialized developed a custom 600 Wh battery that seamlessly integrates into the frame, is lockable, and easily removable for simplified charging. In other words, there's plenty of juice to take you to and from work, a trip to the grocery store, or even to that new café on the other side of the city. If you wish to see exactly how far you can go on a charge, have a look at Specialized's Turbo Range Calculator for more exact estimates.</p><p>The new wired Turbo Connect Display (TCD-w) is the best way to view data on your Turbo. It not only displays important ride metrics (speed, cadence, rider power, distance, battery level, time, etc.), it also allows you to connect the latest version of the Mission Control App for an enhanced Turbo experience. With Specialized free app for iOS and Android phones, you easily customize motor parameters, control your range, record/upload rides, and perform basic system diagnosis.</p><p>And to top off all of the innovative features, we chose a high-end spec with Shimano XT/SLX 11-speed components, four-piston hydraulic disc brakes, an SR SunTour fork with 50mm of travel, integrated front/rear lights, and mounts for fenders and racks. It's ready to take on the town in effortless style.</p><p><span style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; display: inline !important; float: none;\">For further information on what is and isn't allowed in regards to E-bikes in Ontario please </span><a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: #cc3232; text-decoration: none; transition: color 0.3s ease-in-out 0s; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" href=\"http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/driver/electric-bicycles-faq.shtml\">click here</a></p>",

Formulated with high viscosity synthetic oils, water repelling polymers, and advanced anti-wear additives. Wet Lube is Finish Line's strongest, longest lasting and most water resistant lubricant. Wet Lube goes on wet, and stays wet, to provide maximum drivetrain smoothness, extremely quiet rides, and ultimate rust protection in the harshest of environments.</p><p>If you use Wet Lube for riding off-road or in dry climates, be sure to wipe the excess from parts to minimize the attraction of dirt and grime. Since 1994, when Wet Lube was first introduced, it has become the preferred lubricant for many professional on and off-road teams around the world.</p><p>Use Wet Lube when you ride hard and long. Proven performance for 100-plus mile rides, muddy off-road conditions, long rainy commutes, and foggy salt-air coastal climates. A heavier, wet-style lubricant that requires a little more attention to drivetrain cleanliness, but delivers the ultimate in lubricity and protection.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Tri-Flow® Superior Dry Lubricant is an elite formula created for dry and dusty conditions. The drip bottle application, with a convenient straw, allows for deep penetration in hard to reach moving parts. Featuring paraffin wax and high-grade petroleum oil to allow the lube to go on wet, but then set up in a dry, ‘wax-like’ film so it will not attract or absorb grit and grime. Perfect for dry, dirty, dusty conditions, while still providing adequate wet weather performance. Holds up to extreme pressures and resists water wash-off. Provides incredible efficiency without attracting an excessive amount of contaminants.</p>",

These bearings have 35-40% more load capacity than standard radial bearings. Enduro accomplishes this with a special design where the maximum number of balls are inserted into the bearing. The race grooves are deeper on these bearings for more lateral support for the twisting and multiple forces associated with mountain bike pivots. LLU seals give maximum protection against the elements, while keeping the 90% fill of Almagard Extra High Pressure Grease inside.</p><p>*Image may not represent actual product</p>",

Essentially, this forms a glass-like finish that provides a totally natural, and completely inert, solution to the problem of your drinks staining the bottle or leaving behind any residual aftertaste. This infusion also shields your fresh water from tasting like plastic on very hot days, making it akin to drinking straight from a sparkling clean glass.</p><p>And with our MoFlo cap, it's easy to open, effortless to use, and leak-proof when closed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

As with all Arkel panniers, the Metropolitan comes equipped with our patented&nbsp;<a title=\"Link to Cam-Lock mounting system info page\" href=\"https://www.arkel-od.com/useful-03-attachment/\">Cam-Lock mounting&nbsp;system</a>. Whatever road conditions, you can ride in confidence that your pannier will stay attached to the rack. That’s a nice feeling, especially when carrying an&nbsp;expensive laptop. This bag has a rolltop closure system but we also added a zipper at the end of the opening.&nbsp;This means, if you stop for a run of groceries, you’ll be able to leave the bag unrolled and simply use the top zipper closure to keep everything secure. This feature almost doubles the bag’s volume! Another great feature of this bag is the easy grab and go pocket located between the front pocket and the main compartment. This open pocket will quickly become your favorite&nbsp;place to store any small items that need to stay close at hand. The flat bottom keeps the bag upright&nbsp;when resting on the floor.</p><p>This bag is built to last with tough 1000 denier&nbsp;Cordura® fabric. To make this pannier 100% waterproof, we use a&nbsp;TPU laminated internal nylon liner with fully taped seams.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The new Stumpjumper ST uses new tube shapes and an asymmetrical design to ensure that you get awesome ride characteristics. So get ready, because the Stumpjumper ST Alloy 29 is sure to exceed your expectations of how a trail bike should ride.</p><p>Specialized design goal for the new Stumpjumper was simple—build the ultimate trail bike, one that feels telepathic. And it turns out that this feeling all comes down to stiffness. Think of it this way: when the frame's telling your hands one thing and your feet another, your brain gets confused with the imbalance and the bike feels unstable. In order to fix this, Specialized had to get to work on dialing-in the materials and shapes.</p><p>Specialized continued down the suspension path with a custom Rx Trail Tune on both the fork and rear shock. Suspension performance is highly dependent on frame, wheel, and rider size, so Rx Tune is used to get each bike to land in the middle of the adjustment spectrum, and this gives you the biggest possible range to fine-tune your ride. Another focal point of the tune was matching the suspension characteristics between wheel sizes—Specialized developed a specific Rx Tune for each platform. So, no matter what wheel size you prefer, you'll get perfectly linear suspension.</p><p>Steps were also taken to make this bike easy to live with. Threaded bottom brackets make a triumphant return, and there is room for up to a 3.0' tire. You're also free to run whatever aftermarket rear shock you want, since there are standard metric shocks. And customization is furthered with a Flip Chip that lets you to dial-in your Stumpy to your riding style. Switch it from High to Low and it drops your bottom bracket 6mm and slackens the head tube by half-a-degree. Little details also jump out to surprise you, like a newly designed ribbed chainstay protector that makes chain slap a thing of the past and nearly silences the drivetrain.</p><p>The build here is no-nonsense with a focus on dependable, high-performing parts, like Shimano SLX front and rear derailleurs, Tektro Gemini disc brakes, a RockShox Recon RL fork with 130mm of travel, a custom X-Fusion 02 Pro RL rear shock with 120mm of travel, and wide alloy wheels.</p><p>The all-new alloy Stumpjumper ST frame features an M5 alloy front- and rear-end, an asymmetrical design, and 29 Trail Geometry, so it's both capable and comfortable.</p><p>The X-Fusion Metric rear shock features rebound adjustment, lockout, and the coveted Rx Trail Tune to ensure you're getting the most out of your Stumpjumper ST.</p><p>A RockShox Recon RL provides 130mm of travel up front, and it lets you adjust both rebound and lockout.</p><p></p>",

Essentially, this forms a glass-like finish that provides a totally natural, and completely inert, solution to the problem of your drinks staining the bottle or leaving behind any residual aftertaste. This infusion also shields your fresh water from tasting like plastic on very hot days, making it akin to drinking straight from a sparkling clean glass.</p><p>The silicon dioxide coating is a mere 20 nanometers thick which, for comparison, is less than 5,000 times thinner than a human hair. Meanwhile, the shape of the bottle feels equally perfect both in the hand and in the cage.</p><p>It comes equipped with the MoFlo Water Bottle Cap, which delivers 50% more water than other traditional caps. The MoFlo valve is also easy to open, effortless to use, and 100% leak-proof when closed.</p><p>Purist infusion shields the bottle form odor, stains, and mold to keep your water pure and your bottle clean.</p><p>Large screw top design is leak-free and wide enough for ice cubes&nbsp;and scooping in powdered drink mix.</p><p>New MoFlo™ cap design features a wide water channel to deliver up to 50%&nbsp;greater flow than other leading bottles, plus it has&nbsp;improved functional grip.</p><p>Made from easy-to-squeeze LDPE material.</p><p>Clear viewing strip makes it easy to see the bottle's contents.</p><p>BPA-Free plastic is made from 100%&nbsp;FDA food-grade materials, and it's printed with non-solvent&nbsp;base (UV Cured), CPSC-approved ink and materials.</p><p>Available in 22oz and 26oz Purist Bottles.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Look no further than Specialized S-Wrap Roubaix Handlebar Tape.</p><p>For the construction, it features a pairing of a grippy suede finish with vibration-absorbing EVA foam. This means that you'll experience less slip and a significant reduction in hand fatigue. And after witnessing so many mechanics putting up double-wrap, Specialized&nbsp; even took it step further by including by adding an elastomer gel backing for even more comfort and support. If this sounds thick and clumsy, though, don't worry. This tape is extra wide, so your wrap job will remain sleek and low profile. Specialized even made it to be highly stretchable with feathered edges to make sure of it.</p><p>A suede finish has been paired with EVA vibration-damping foam for non-slip comfort and a clean aesthetic.</p><p>Extra wide design creates a smoother finish and easier installation.</p><p>Elastomer gel backing provides additional comfort and vibration damping.</p><p>Easy-stretch tape with feathered edges makes the finished wrap smooth and low profile.</p>",

With plenty of pockets and storage capacity,&nbsp;this waterproof bag will easily carry all your office gear and more. As with all Arkel panniers, the Metropolitan comes equipped with our patented&nbsp;<a title=\"Link to Cam-Lock mounting system info page\" href=\"https://www.arkel-od.com/useful-03-attachment/\">Cam-Lock mounting&nbsp;system</a>. Whatever road conditions, you can ride in confidence that your pannier will stay attached to the rack. That’s a nice feeling, especially when carrying an&nbsp;expensive laptop. This bag has a rolltop closure system but we also added a zipper at the end of the opening.&nbsp;This means, if you stop for a run of groceries, you’ll be able to leave the bag unrolled and simply use the top zipper closure to keep everything secure. This feature almost doubles the bag’s volume! Another great feature of this bag is the easy grab and go pocket located between the front pocket and the main compartment. This open pocket will quickly become your favorite&nbsp;place to store any small items that need to stay close at hand. The flat bottom keeps the bag upright&nbsp;when resting on the floor.</p><p>This bag is built to last with tough 1000 denier&nbsp;Cordura® fabric. To make this pannier 100% waterproof, we use a&nbsp;TPU laminated internal nylon liner with fully taped seams.</p>",

Lighter weight than Specialized's standard Therminal Warmer collection, this seamless version is perfect to stash in a jersey pocket when you need a little extra protection on a fast descent or for a long climb in the shadows.</p><p>They used a yarn that offers good loft for trapping body heat and adding a good sense of durability, while a knit construction allows for excellent air permeability and breathability. This technique and design also comes with the added benefit of aligning with your knee, so the warmers will stay put with just the right amount of compression at the cuffs.</p><p>Therminal fabrics feature a brushed fleece interior that insulates, while remaining highly breathable and effective at managing moisture.</p><p>Engineered construction minimizes edges and stitching, creating a smooth, compressive feel against your skin.</p><p>Knitted articualtion and openings keep the warmers in place for the perfect fit.</p><p>Deflect™ UV 50+ protects your skin from harmful ultraviolet rays.</p>",

No one else offers such a solid and reliable mounting system for bike panniers. Many smaller details make this bag unique, an internal organizer for easy access to documents, maps, tablet, wallet, etc. This means you won’t have to empty half the bag to reach these. A plastic protector at the bottom backside of the pannier adds protection between the bag and the rack and will avoid any premature wear caused by friction against the rack. Arkel also added D-rings for an&nbsp;optional shoulder strap.&nbsp;This is very practical when travelling at the airport or simply carrying your panniers around at the end of a long ride.

It does this through a pairing with our Specialized Ride App for iOS or Android devices. And if it detects a crash, it commences a countdown that, if you’re ok, you can stop and keep riding. If, however, ANGi determines that you’re in need of help, it’ll send an alert to your selected contacts with your last known GPS coordinates and a message that you’re in need of help. What about if you’re out of service coverage? ANGi has a plan for that. Just set your estimated ride time before you head out when you know that your ride will take you out of range. All you need is an active data signal when you start your session. And if you haven’t completed your ride within that time frame, ANGi will send a notification to your contacts with your last uploaded location.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

A core stalwart of the collection, the MT500 II Neoprene Overshoe has been a best-seller for many years. Endura knows a thing or two about foul weather gear and this waterproof durable overshoe is the result of years of testing in the worst possible conditions. Endura’s unique moulded rubber toe cap with a ridged underside provides grip when climbing steep and muddy slopes. <br><br></p><p><strong>Waterproof</strong></p><p>Durable faced neoprene outer fabric provides total waterproofing from above, keeping your feet warm and dry inside. A durable sole with cleat access points stitched with a bulletproof aramid thread extends the lifespan beyond other more flimsy alternatives on the market. <br><br></p><p><strong>Functional Detail</strong></p><p>The overshoe zipper is covered by neoprene which butts together at the rear and improves water tightness. A snug fit is guaranteed with the Velcro® heel tab. <br><br></p><p><strong>Finish Detail</strong></p><p>There is a reflective detail print to help keep you safe. <br><br></p><p><strong>Fit</strong></p><p>This product is in a standard fit suitable for wearing over all MTB cleated shoes.</p>",

    "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.financeit.ca/en/direct/payment-plan/cD1HMGUwRjBpU1BqeTlHN25OOVFUZ1pnJnM9MCZ2PTQmZj0mdD0mbD0mYT0yMDkyOTc=/apply\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shoplightspeed.com/shops/622502/files/15580633/finan.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1009\" height=\"140\"></a></p><p>Beginning with the integrated Specialized 1.2 E motor, the Turbo Vado proves itself as the ultimate city bike. The 1.2 E uses the same hardware as our 1.2 motor, but it features a tune that prioritizes efficiency. This means less peak torque and maximum output. Of course, it still features a near-silent operating design with our Custom Rx Street Tune that takes the output and makes it the most usable for an urban environment. Think of it this way: The more power you put out, the more power the motor puts out, and this makes accelerations from a standstill at, say, a traffic light both quick and efficient. The belt driven motor is also smooth, silent, and free of annoying vibrations. And the max speed? 28mph.</p><p>For the Vado 3.0, we developed a custom Specialized U1-460 battery that seamlessly integrates into the frame, is lockable, and easily removable for simplified charging. In other words, there's plenty of juice to take you to and from work, a trip to the grocery store, or even to that new café on the other side of the city. If you wish to see exactly how far you can go on a charge, have a look at Specialized's Turbo Range Calculator for more exact estimates.</p><p>The new Turbo Connect Display (TCD) is the best way to view data on your Turbo. It not only displays basic ride metrics (speed, cadence, power, battery level, and time), but it also lets you toggle between modes. Its design, meanwhile, is rugged and clean, and it has multiple mounting options for either road or mountain setups. As for the latest version of the Mission Control App, you’ll find that it now has more features and is even more intuitive to use. It lets you custom-tune nearly every aspect of the bike with ease, monitor your power usage, control your range, perform basic system diagnoses, and record/upload rides.</p><p>To top off all of the innovative features, we chose a worry-free spec that features Shimano 9-speed components, hydraulic disc brakes, front/rear lights, and fender &amp; rack mounts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Turbo Vado features a lightweight alloy frame that’s been designed with Fitness/Transportation Geometry.</p><p>The Turbo Vado’s Specialized 1.2 E motor emphasizes efficiency and range. They also fully integrated it with the frame, and it's been custom-tuned for city riding. It intuitively reacts to the force of your pedaling, so the harder you pedal, the more power it delivers. And with an internal belt drive design, it does this without added vibration for the smoothest and most silent ride possible.</p><p>Specialized made the custom 460 Wh battery to be fully integrated with the frame, removable for easy charging, and lockable for added security. It communicates with the display and has multiple modes to maximize the overall efficiency and range. For range estimates based upon a variety of variables, please refer to Specialized's Turbo Range Calculator.</p><p>Canada Maximum motor speed: 20 mph / 32 km/h</p><p><span style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; display: inline !important; float: none;\">For further information on what is and isn't allowed in regards to E-bikes in Ontario please </span><a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: #cc3232; text-decoration: none; transition: color 0.3s ease-in-out 0s; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" href=\"http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/driver/electric-bicycles-faq.shtml\">click here</a></p>",

    "description": "<p>Finish Line began innovating chain cleaners back in 1988 when its patented rotating brush design set the standard. For the first time a bicycle chain could be thoroughly cleaned in a minute or two without taking it off the bike. Quick, efficient and easy to use.</p><p></p><p>Since 1988 Finish Line has innovated two new generations of chain cleaners. The new third generation chain cleaner has once again redefined the way bicycle chains are being cleaned, both in shops and at home.</p><p>Finish Line's proprietary rotating brushes are still utilized in the third generation unit. However, the exit angle has been changed from 90 degrees to 47 degrees, which virtually eliminates drips and spills. An additional row of scrapper pads have been added for enhanced side-plate cleaning. A large magnet has been added to attract and hold magnetized wear particles and is located at the bottom of the chain cleaner. New shop quality plastic prevents shattering when dropped.</p><p>For cyclists who are serious about keeping their drivetrain in race-ready condition, Finish Line's Pro Chain Cleaner is a valuable piece of equipment that will make this tedious task much easier.</p><p>Use once or twice a month to maximize your bicycle's chain life and enjoy a cleaner, smoother, and more efficient drivetrain.</p>",

Most people look forward to a season full of long days in the saddle. But nagging aches or pains can suck the enjoyment right out of cycling and turn a long ride into a REALLY long ride. Life’s far too short for that nonsense – particularly since most cycling discomfort is easily eliminated through proper bike fit. For most people, this requires the help of a professional.</p><p>Bikes come in a limited number of shapes and sizes. Cyclists do not.

For cyclists on the go, 1-Step is the perfect choice for maintaining your bicycle's drivetrain.</p><p>1-Step is recommended for cyclists who take a minimalist approach to drivetrain maintenance. It is formulated with rust and corrosion inhibitors that provide ultimate protection in extreme conditions including coastal salt air. 1-Step does not compromise on its ability to reduce pedaling friction over long intervals, often exceeding 100 miles. Professional mechanics also use 1-Step to free gummed-up shifters and stiff cables.</p>",

    "description": "<p>We took a cue from cold water surfers footwear and created a barrier to wetness with the Deflect H2O Shoe Cover. Three things make the upper work to keep you dry: A neoprene body material repels water and stretches to conform to your every contour, the seams are heat taped to prevent water intrusion and a YKK® AquaGuard® zipper provides easy entry and exit and seals itself when closed. Finally, there's a vulcanized rubber sole with molded tread for off-the bike grip, traction and durability. Reflective trims keep you visiable to drivers in low light conditions.</p><p>Insulating and waterproof neoprene features an interior and exterior nylon knit that helps repel water and stretches to conform to any shoe, including ones with dial adjusters.</p><p>Heat taping seals up stitch holes for less water infiltration and provides added seam durability.</p><p>YKK AquaGuard® water-repellant rear zippers seal out water and provide easy entry and exit.</p><p>Vulcanized rubber outsole is attached without stitching, eliminating water intrusion points and provides sure-footed traction.</p><p>Universal cleat opening means that the covers are compatible with all cleat styles, but they're specifically for road shoes.</p><p>Reflective elements increase your visibility to motorists and other riders in low-light conditions.</p>",

Their welded seam technology ensures that the bag will stay dry no matter the conditions you ride in and the patented Cam-Lock® mounting system will keep the bags on the rack, regardless of the load or road conditions. No one else offers such a solid and reliable mounting system for bike panniers. Many smaller details make this bag unique, an internal organizer for easy access to documents, maps, tablet, wallet, etc. This means you won’t have to empty half the bag to reach these. A plastic protector at the bottom backside of the pannier adds protection between the bag and the rack and will avoid any premature wear caused by friction against the rack. Arkel also added D-rings for an&nbsp;optional shoulder strap, This is very practical when travelling at the airport or simply carrying your panniers around at the end of a long ride. Many small details make these panniers functional, durable and most importantly fun to use.</p><p>Fully Waterproof RF welded seams.</p><p>Patented Cam-Lock® mounting system.</p><p>Front exterior zippered pocket.</p><p>Internal organizer for important papers, tablet, etc...</p><p>Tabs to mount blinker lights.</p><p>Reflective material on all sides.</p><p>Will fit front or rear racks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Front or Rear<br><strong>Weight</strong>: 1.86 kg / 4.1 lbs (pair)&nbsp;without&nbsp;removable internal cradle&nbsp;- 2.12kg / 4.6 lbs (pair)&nbsp;with&nbsp;removable internal cradle<br><strong>Volume</strong>: 35 l. / 2140 cu. in.

    "description": "<p>If having fun for the sake of having fun sounds appealing to you, \"going fat\" will change the way you ride forever. The security and control that the wheel system, found on the Fatboy SE, provides is unparalleled. You get dramatically more traction, grip, and floatation than with traditional mountain tires, all without sacrificing much to climbing efficiency.</p><p>The end result is easy to explain—you have way more fun. And to make sure of it, Specialized built the Fatboy with a durable, no-nonsense list of components that are low-maintenance and eager to perform season after season.</p><p>The frame features an M5 alloy construction that provides the ideal blend of efficiency and durability, while the geometry creates a roomy top tube and short chainstays for easy climbing and confident descending.</p><p>The alloy fork with air-formed legs is lightweight and pairs up perfectly with the fat wheel system to soak up trail chatter and bumps.</p><p>The Shimano 10-speed groupset features a wide gear range that delivers climbing and descending efficiency in spades. On top of this, the one-by setup is notorious for being next to impossible to drop a chain with, plus it provides a significant weight savings in comparison to a standard two-by setup.</p>",

For most people, this requires the help of a professional.</p><p>Bikes come in a limited number of shapes and sizes. Cyclists do not.

ABUS is not new to alarm lock technology having produced motorcycle disc alarm locks for over ten years. The alarm is designed to not prematurely activate, allowing for movements that might happen while a bike is locked in tight quarters. Continued movements will set off the alarm for 15 seconds and will repeat until movement stops. Thanks to the patent pending “intelligent transport position”, activation is also avoided during transportation. The battery and activity status is displayed by means of acoustic signals giving the owner ample notice if a battery replacement is needed.</p>",

It is directly descending from the B66 Champion, first featured in the 1927 catalogue. Sharing the same leather tops of the B17 models, they combine the comfort of these popular models with the extra suspension granted by two rear springs. Both are available with tubular steel rivets or with hand hammered copper rivets under the names of Flyer Special and Flyer S Special.</span></p>",

Sourced from premium materials, 49N tubes use a strong and highly elastic rubber compound with reinforced seams and careful sealing around the valves. All tubes are test-inflated for 24 hours to guarantee consistent high quality for every tube.</p> \n<p>All presta valve 49N tubes also have removable valve cores, meaning you can run sealant in the tube, replace damaged cores or run valve extenders for deep dish rims!</p>",

Since there is no liquid latex or ammonia in Finish Line sealant, it is naturally non-toxic, hypoallergenic and safe for carbon fiber rims.

Utilizing DuPont™ Kevlar® fibers, FiberLink™ seals are extremely robust once they plug a hole. When a puncture happens, fibers rush into the wound and quickly stop air loss. As the tire flexes while it is ridden, the FiberLink™ mesh tightens and reinforces itself, creating a confidence-inspiring seal that will last ride-after-ride.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p> \n<p><span>Available in&nbsp;1-gallon bottles for shops and rental fleets, as well as convenient 4oz, 8oz, and 1L consumer sizes.&nbsp;</span></p>",

    "description": "<meta charset=\"utf-8\"><span>Tri-Flow® Superior Dry Lubricant is an elite formula created for dry and dusty conditions. The drip bottle application, with a convenient straw, allows for deep penetration in hard to reach moving parts. Featuring paraffin wax and high-grade petroleum oil to allow the lube to go on wet, but then set up in a dry, ‘wax-like’ film so it will not attract or absorb grit and grime. Perfect for dry, dirty, dusty conditions, while still providing adequate wet weather performance. Holds up to extreme pressures and resists water wash-off. Provides incredible efficiency without attracting an excessive amount of contaminants.</span>",

Constructed with Columbus Thron tubing and matched with a Columbus Futura carbon fork, the Vigorelli was designed in conjunction with the riders of Team Cinelli Chrome, Red Hook Crit Champions. Named after the iconic Vigorelli velodrome in Milan, Cinelli’s flagship track bike is perfectly balanced thanks to the advanced engineering and varying diameters of the tubing. Not only is it a high-speed racer on the track and the street, the forks have a pre-drilled brake hole should you need to fit a front brake on it for commuting or leisure riding – the hole is filled with wax and painted over for a clean look.</span></p> \n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">",

Our workshop was created out of the desire to build gear as tough as it is beautiful. It’s this pursuit that has kept us at it for more than 20 years.</p> \n <p>In 2009, down an alleyway in what was once referred to as “The Messenger Ghetto,” surrounded by taquerias and dive bars, we rolled up our sleeves and got to work refurbishing an old warehouse to call home. After a few months of being covered in steel splinters,<span>&nbsp;</span>sheet rock<span>&nbsp;</span>dust, and moldy insulation, we cut the ribbon on our shiny new workspace, storefront, and headquarters. (We’re still in the same spot today and invite you to stop by any time and share some stories and a beverage of one sort or another).</p> \n <p>Along the way we’ve worked with our best friends, made new friends, and created a community of folks who share a similar outlook on life. Our full history goes way back to 1994 when my co-founder Mark Falvai and our good friend Doug Hudson started the company Chrome Industries which helped spark an entire movement in technical lifestyle cycling bags and apparel.</p> \n</div>",

    "description": "<meta charset=\"utf-8\"> \n<p><span>Skratch Labs&nbsp;</span><strong>Sport Hydration Drink Mix</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>was created for a simple purpose - to replace the electrolytes lost in sweat and to provide a little bit of energy when working out, without offending your palate or gut.</p> \n<p>Skratch initially created this drink because some of the world’s best athletes needed better. Conventional sports drinks made them sick. They were undrinkable - too sweet, over-flavored, and didn’t even replace what was lost in sweat – which defeated the whole purpose, like fighting thirst with more thirst.</p> \n<p>The best athletes needed something to safely hydrate, something to quench their thirst, and something to help them perform better. So with their help,<span>&nbsp;they&nbsp;</span><em>reimagined sports drinks, stripping down what use to be a neon-colored carnival to its bare essentials</em>. The result is a sports drink with less sugar (4% or 4 g per 100 ml) and a ratio of sugar (glucose + fructose) that is optimized for faster absorption, an electrolyte profile that actually matches what is lost in sweat (800 mg sodium, 80 mg potassium, 100 mg calcium, and 80 mg of magnesium per liter), and only real fruit for flavor for a light and refreshing taste that you can drink all day. That’s it - less sugar, the right electrolyte profile, and real fruit. So, if you’ve never met a sports drink you wanted to take home, your luck is about to change.</p> \n<p>Also, you might like to know that these drink mixes are<span>&nbsp;</span><span><a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2626/6666/files/NGP_Cert_-_Skratch_Labs.pdf?3873188726534156679\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">verified non-GMO</a></span>, gluten free, dairy free, vegan and<span>&nbsp;</span><span><a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0121/9362/files/SkratchLabs_Kosher_JUNE2019.pdf?10575316875779201002\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kosher</a>&nbsp;</span>cause that's just how they came out.</p>",

    "description": "<meta charset=\"utf-8\"> \n<p><span>Skratch Labs&nbsp;</span><strong>Sport Hydration Drink Mix</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>was created for a simple purpose - to replace the electrolytes lost in sweat and to provide a little bit of energy when working out, without offending your palate or gut.</p> \n<p>Skratch initially created this drink because some of the world’s best athletes needed better. Conventional sports drinks made them sick. They were undrinkable - too sweet, over-flavored, and didn’t even replace what was lost in sweat – which defeated the whole purpose, like fighting thirst with more thirst.</p> \n<p>The best athletes needed something to safely hydrate, something to quench their thirst, and something to help them perform better. So with their help,<span>&nbsp;they&nbsp;</span><em>reimagined sports drinks, stripping down what use to be a neon-colored carnival to its bare essentials</em>. The result is a sports drink with less sugar (4% or 4 g per 100 ml) and a ratio of sugar (glucose + fructose) that is optimized for faster absorption, an electrolyte profile that actually matches what is lost in sweat (800 mg sodium, 80 mg potassium, 100 mg calcium, and 80 mg of magnesium per liter), and only real fruit for flavor for a light and refreshing taste that you can drink all day. That’s it - less sugar, the right electrolyte profile, and real fruit. So, if you’ve never met a sports drink you wanted to take home, your luck is about to change.</p> \n<p>Also, you might like to know that these drink mixes are<span>&nbsp;</span><span><a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2626/6666/files/NGP_Cert_-_Skratch_Labs.pdf?3873188726534156679\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">verified non-GMO</a></span>, gluten free, dairy free, vegan and<span>&nbsp;</span><span><a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0121/9362/files/SkratchLabs_Kosher_JUNE2019.pdf?10575316875779201002\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kosher</a>&nbsp;</span>cause that's just how they came out.</p>",

Tailormade for the demands of the modern metropolis, they let you flow through the grind, bypass the gridlock and embrace the city on your own terms. This is where it all begins. When you decide to work out, not in. When you trade-in four walls for two wheels. And you become the one who’s taking you places. Your journey starts here, with the comfort, confidence, and speed of the Quick. Start the cycle. With lightest-in-class weights, bright reflective graphics and a smooth, stable ride, the sporty Quick is the fast, fun way to get fit or get around town.<br><br>All Quick models feature bright 360° reflective elements for that extra measure of safety. Enhanced SAVE Micro-Suspension features in the rear triangle, plus ergonomic grips, saddle, and pedals keep riders comfortable and connected. OutFront Steering Geometry makes the Quick so stable, so confident and such swoopy fun to ride, that you might just forget you’re working out. In true Cannondale form, Quick bikes are the lightest in their class. Easier to pedal, easier to lift, easier to love! Both Quick SL and Quick frames share a geometry that offers an easy reach to the bars and feature consistent jumps in stack and reach across all sizes, for easy fitting.<br><strong><br>Key Features<br></strong></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Quick SL, SmartForm C2 Alloy Frame, SAVE.</li> \n <li>ALL-NEW Quick Disc Carbon thru-axle Fork, tapered steerer, OutFront offset</li> \n <li>Shimano 105 Drivetrain, 11-speed / MT201 Hydro Disc Brakes</li> \n <li>Schwalbe Spicer Tires, reflective, K-Guard puncture protection</li> \n</ul> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<meta charset=\"utf-8\"> \n<table class=\"table table-alternatingLight w-100 description-table\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Frame</span></th> \n   <td><span>SmartForm C3 Alloy, SAVE, tapered head tube, Straight shot hidden cable routing, flat mount disc, rack/fender mounts, 36° reflectivity</span></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Fork</span></th> \n   <td><span>Full carbon, 12x100mm thru-axle, 1-1/4” to 1-1/8” tapered steerer, flat mount disc, fender mounts, 36° reflectivity</span></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Front Derailleur</span></th> \n   <td><span>Shimano 105, 31.8 clamp</span></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Rear Derailleur</span></th> \n   <td><span>Shimano 105 GS</span></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Number of Gears</span></th> \n   <td><span>22</span></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Shifters</span></th> \n   <td><span>Shimano RS700 FB, 2x11</span></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Chain set</span></th> \n   <td><span>FSA Omega, 50/34</span></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Bottom Bracket</span></th> \n   <td><span>FSA MegaExo</span></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Cassette</span></th> \n   <td><span>Shimano 105, 11-32, 11-speed</span></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Chain</span></th> \n   <td><span>Shimano HG601, 11-speed</span></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Pedals</span></th> \n   <td><span>Supplied</span></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Brakeset</span></th> \n   <td><span>Shimano MT201 hydro disc, 160/160mm RT56 rotors</span></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Handlebars</span></th> \n   <td><span>Cannondale Riser, 6061 Alloy, 18mm rise, 8° back, 4° up, 640mm</span></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Stem</span></th> \n   <td><span>Cannondale 3 with Intellimount, alloy, 31.8mm clamp</span></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Grips</span></th> \n   <td><span>Cannondale Ergo Fitness Dual Density, lock-on</span></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Rims</span></th> \n   <td><span>Cannondale Disc, double wall, 32h</span></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Front Hub</span></th> \n   <td><span>Formula CRX-512, 12x100</span></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Rear Hub</span></th> \n   <td><span>Formula CX-22 QR</span></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Tyres</span></th> \n   <td><span>Schwalbe Lugano, 700 x 32c, K-Guard, reflective strip</span></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Saddle</span></th> \n   <td><span>Cannondale Quick Ergo Performance</span></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Seatpost</span></th> \n   <td><span>Cannondale 3, 6061 Alloy, 27.2 x 350mm</span></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th class=\"text-right\"><span>Weight</span></th> \n   <td><span>No Weight Information Available</span></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table>",

Once installed, the wheel locks remain permanently on your bicycle, even when you ride. When you need to remove your wheels for servicing, your Pinhead key lets you do this quickly and easily. Pinhead locks cannot be removed with tools such as hammers, pliers, picks, universal socket tools, grinders or bolt cutters. Our convex disc technology prevents your wheels from being removed by bike thieves.</address>\n<address>&nbsp;</address>\n<address>Our locks use a special coded key that comes with each lockset. The key is ergonomically engineered to install and tighten your locks, and also serves as a bottle opener. Each key is different and comes engraved with a nine-digit code so it can be replaced if lost. With your key code matching, locks can be ordered to protect your other components or other bikes.</address>\n<address>&nbsp;</address>\n<address>All components are precision-forged from corrosion-resistant CrMo steel and aircraft aluminum alloys. Pinhead locks are unmatched in quality and backed by a lifetime warranty.</address>",

Featuring a strong and durable braided hose which stops the hose from twisting and its generous length allows tyres to be inflated whilst your bike is held securely in a bike stand or on the floor. The Smart head of the valve makes for ease of inflation as you simply push fit onto either Presta or Schrader for instant inflation. The handle and base of the pump have both been constructed using strong and treated wood, the handle has been shaped for comfort and the base is wide enough for great stability when inflating the final effort. Overall the Fabric floor pump is ideal to keep in your garage, shed or even the back of your car if you find yourself venturing beyond your bounds.</span>",

And with inspiration from Norco mountain bikes – such as 1by drivetrains and 650B wheels with large volume tires – the Scene is a real showstopper.</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<meta charset=\"utf-8\"> \n<div class=\"text-center text-uppercase mx-0\"> \n <h2>SPECIFICATIONS</h2> \n</div> \n<div class=\"container\"> \n <div class=\"row mt-5 mb-3\"> \n  <div class=\"col-12 offset-lg-1 col-lg-10\"> \n   <ul> \n    <li>FRAMESET</li> \n    <li>FRAME</li> \n    <li>Norco Scene, Aluminum, 9x135mm QR Dropouts, Eccentric BB</li> \n    <li>FORK</li> \n    <li>Norco Hi-Tensile Steel Hybrid Fork, 9x100mm QR</li> \n    <li>HEADSET</li> \n    <li>Internal Semi-Cartridge</li> \n    <li>HEADSET SPACER</li> \n    <li>2x10mm, 1x5mm, Aluminum</li> \n    <li>DRIVETRAIN</li> \n    <li>CASSETTE</li> \n    <li>Shimano Alfine CS-S500, 21T</li> \n    <li>CHAIN</li> \n    <li>KMC Z1 Narrow, Single Speed</li> \n    <li>CRANKSET</li> \n    <li>Alloy, 165mm (S) | 170mm (M/L/XL), 42T</li> \n    <li>BOTTOM BRACKET</li> \n    <li>Sealed Cartridge BB, Threaded BSA 68mm</li> \n    <li>PEDALS</li> \n    <li>PP City Pedal w/Traction Inlay - Black</li> \n    <li>SHIFTER REAR</li> \n    <li>Shimano Nexus SL-C6000, RevoShift, 8 Speed</li> \n    <li>COMPONENTS</li> \n    <li>GRIPS</li> \n    <li>Dual Density Ergonomic, Lock-On, Black</li> \n    <li>HANDLEBAR</li> \n    <li>Norco Custom High Rise City Bar - Black</li> \n    <li>STEM</li> \n    <li>Alloy 17 Rise - Black</li> \n    <li>SEAT POST</li> \n    <li>Alloy, 15mm Offset, 27.2mm</li> \n    <li>SEAT POST CLAMP</li> \n    <li>Alloy, Bolted Clamp, Black</li> \n    <li>SADDLE</li> \n    <li>Norco Comfort Saddle w/Elastomers</li> \n    <li>FRONT BRAKE</li> \n    <li>Shimano BR-MT200, Hydraulic Disc, Shimano Center Lock 160mm Rotor</li> \n    <li>REAR BRAKE</li> \n    <li>Shimano BR-MT200, Hydraulic Disc, Shimano Center Lock 160mm Rotor</li> \n    <li>BRAKE LEVERS</li> \n    <li>Shimano BL-MT201, 3 Finger Levers</li> \n    <li>WHEELS</li> \n    <li>FRONT HUB</li> \n    <li>Shimano CentreLock 32H- Black</li> \n    <li>REAR HUB</li> \n    <li>Shimano Nexus SG-C6001-8, 32 Hole, 10x135mm QR</li> \n    <li>SPOKES/NIPPLES</li> \n    <li>Stainless Steel w/Brass Nipples - Black</li> \n    <li>RIMS</li> \n    <li>Double Wall Alloy, 32 Hole, 27mm Interal Width</li> \n    <li>FRONT TIRE</li> \n    <li>Kenda Kwick Seven.5, 27.5x2.2”, Gumwall, 60 TPI</li> \n    <li>REAR TIRE</li> \n    <li>Kenda Kwick Seven.5, 27.5x2.2”, Gumwall, 60 TPI</li> \n    <li>REAR HUB SKEWER</li> \n    <li>Shimano Nutted Axle</li> \n    <li>FRONT HUB SKEWER</li> \n    <li>Bolted skewer</li> \n   </ul> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <div class=\"row\"></div> \n</div>",

    "description": "<meta charset=\"utf-8\"> \n<p><span>The Norco Scene is not another hybrid re-run. Rated ‘R’ for rad, the Scene’s modern spin on the upright, hybrid bike will have you doing a double take. Don’t let the step-thru design throw you – it’s all part of the Scene’s laid-back personality, offering casual convenience for all – especially when hauling heavy loads like kids’ seats and trail-a-bikes. Not one to be typecast, the Scene is perfect for family rides, cruising with the crew, or quick trips to refill a growler. And with inspiration from Norco mountain bikes – such as 1by drivetrains and 650B wheels with large volume tires – the Scene is a real showstopper.</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<meta charset=\"utf-8\"> \n<div class=\"text-center text-uppercase mx-0\"> \n <ul> \n  <li>SPECIFICATIONS</li> \n  <li>FRAMESET</li> \n  <li>FORK</li> \n  <li>Norco Hi-Tensile Steel Hybrid Fork, 9x100mm QR</li> \n  <li>HEADSET</li> \n  <li>Zero Stack Headset w/26mm Cone Spacer - Black</li> \n  <li>HEADSET SPACER</li> \n  <li>2x10mm, 1x5mm, Aluminum</li> \n  <li>DRIVETRAIN</li> \n  <li>REAR DERAILLEUR</li> \n  <li>Shimano Tourney RD-TY500, 7 Speed</li> \n  <li>CASSETTE</li> \n  <li>SunRace CSM40, 11-34T, 7 Speed</li> \n  <li>CHAIN</li> \n  <li>KMC Z51, 7 Speed</li> \n  <li>CRANKSET</li> \n  <li>Alloy, 165mm (S) | 170mm (M/L/XL), 36T</li> \n  <li>BOTTOM BRACKET</li> \n  <li>Sealed Cartridge BB, Threaded BSA 68mm</li> \n  <li>PEDALS</li> \n  <li>PP City Pedal w/Traction Inlay - Black</li> \n  <li>SHIFTER REAR</li> \n  <li>Shimano Altus M310, RapidFire Plus, 7 Speed</li> \n  <li>COMPONENTS</li> \n  <li>GRIPS</li> \n  <li>Dual Density Ergonomic, Black</li> \n  <li>HANDLEBAR</li> \n  <li>Norco Custom High Rise City Bar - Black</li> \n  <li>STEM</li> \n  <li>Alloy 17 Rise - Black</li> \n  <li>SEAT POST</li> \n  <li>Alloy, 15mm Offset, 27.2mm</li> \n  <li>SEAT POST CLAMP</li> \n  <li>Alloy, Quick Release, Black</li> \n  <li>SADDLE</li> \n  <li>Norco Comfort Saddle w/Elastomers - Black</li> \n  <li>FRONT BRAKE</li> \n  <li>Tektro MD-M280, Mechanical Disc, 160mm Rotor</li> \n  <li>REAR BRAKE</li> \n  <li>Tektro MD-M280, Mechanical Disc, 160mm Rotor</li> \n  <li>BRAKE LEVERS</li> \n  <li>Tektro RS-360A, 2 Finger Levers</li> \n  <li>WHEELS</li> \n  <li>FRONT HUB</li> \n  <li>Alloy Sealed Disc Hub</li> \n  <li>REAR HUB</li> \n  <li>Alloy Sealed Disc Hub, 32 Hole, 10x135mm QR</li> \n  <li>SPOKES/NIPPLES</li> \n  <li>Stainless Steel w/Brass Nipples - Black</li> \n  <li>RIMS</li> \n  <li>Double Wall Alloy, 32 Hole, 27mm Interal Width</li> \n  <li>FRONT TIRE</li> \n  <li>Kenda Kwick Seven.5, 27.5x2.2”, 30 TPI</li> \n  <li>REAR TIRE</li> \n  <li>Kenda Kwick Seven.5, 27.5x2.2”, 30 TPI</li> \n  <li>REAR HUB SKEWER</li> \n  <li>Alloy Quick Release - Black</li> \n  <li>FRONT HUB SKEWER</li> \n  <li>Alloy Quick Release - Black</li> \n </ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"container\"> \n <div class=\"row\"></div> \n</div>",

Additionally, the updated fiberglass reinforced backplate has loops for a saddle bag or other accessory.\n    </div> \n    <div class=\"npp_tab_content\"></div> \n    <div class=\"npp_tab_content\"> \n     <meta charset=\"utf-8\"> \n     <div class=\"npp-features-delivery npp-features-3col\"> \n      <div class=\"npp-info-box\"> \n       <p>TECHNICAL INFORMATION</p> \n       <ul> \n        <li> <span>&nbsp;</span><span>LENGTH:</span><span>&nbsp;</span>275 mm</li> \n        <li> <span>&nbsp;</span><span>WIDTH:</span><span>&nbsp;</span>184 mm</li> \n        <li> <span>&nbsp;</span><span>HEIGHT:</span><span>&nbsp;</span>57 mm</li> \n        <li> <span>&nbsp;</span><span>WEIGHT:</span><span>&nbsp;</span>490 gr</li> \n       </ul> \n      </div> \n     </div> <span>&nbsp;</span> \n     <div class=\"npp-features-delivery npp-features-3col\"> \n      <div class=\"npp-info-box\"> \n       <p>MATERIAL</p> \n       <ul> \n        <li> <span>&nbsp;</span>VULCANISED NATURAL RUBBER AND NYLON TOP</li> \n        <li> <span>&nbsp;</span>STEEL RAILS WITH A REINFORCED PLASTIC BACKPLATE</li> \n        <li> <span>&nbsp;</span>MADE IN ITALY</li> \n       </ul> \n      </div> \n     </div> <span>&nbsp;</span> \n     <div class=\"npp-features-delivery npp-features-3col\"> \n      <div class=\"npp-info-box\"> \n       <p>CARE INFORMATION</p> \n       <ul> \n        <li> <span>&nbsp;</span>This Cambium Saddle is manufactured in Italy and guaranteed against defects in materials or workmanship for 2 years from the date of purchase.</li> \n       </ul> \n      </div> \n     </div> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n   <div></div> \n   <div></div> \n   <div></div> \n   <div></div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"modular-multi-image on_desktop_only\"></div> \n<div class=\"npp-sticky-footer\"> \n <div class=\"on_desktop_only\"> \n  <div class=\"npp-sticky-left-block\"> \n   <div class=\"npp-sticky-text-wrapper\"></div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</div>",

It had to be gravity capable, climb like a banshee, cruise across town, encourage you to play and launch off of every obstacle, and slay single track like no other. It was a laundry list of hopes and dreams and hot dang do we feel like this shred sled delivers on all fronts.<br><br>Behold the fruits of our labor: The Electric Queen. The ultimate “Trail” hardtail. Short wheelbase, aggressive trail geometry, 120mm suspension fork, and fits 27.5 x 3.0” or 29 x 2.25” tires.<br><br>If the Log Lady was our love song to the hardcore single track single speeders, this is the encore dedicated to those who want to destroy everything in their path and send it&nbsp;off of everything in sight.<br><br>It features the modern suite of mountain standards: stealth dropper routing, Boost spacing, thru-axles, 44mm head tube, and because we’re All-City, two bottle mounts.</p> \n<p>New for this second offering of Electric Queen are framesets. We've built a superb segmented rigid fork to compliment the steel frame, and are including that with the frames. If you bought a complete and also want a rigid fork, no worries, painted to match forks will be available in both the cyan splatter and the original yellow/pink fade splatter.&nbsp;<br><br>If you’re looking for a bike that can handle hardcore trail riding, doesn’t mind the dirt jumps, is actually fun to pedal around on, and doesn’t require the maintenance or hassle of a full suspension rig, the Electric Queen is an awesome choice.<br><br>*Geo is given at 25% sag*</p>",

It features delicately hand skived lower sides, where a thin stripe of the leather top surface is cut back, thus exposing the lighter colored suede beneath which makes for an attractive visual accent and greater comfort when pedalling. The large copper rivets at the nose and tail are also hammered by hand, commensurate with our usual high level of attention to detail. As is the case with all of our hand manufactured saddles, the Swift proudly sports a metal nameplate at the rear, and in addition two embossed graphic details on the sides featuring the saddle name and incorporating an icon of a Swift in flight. On introduction, the Swift was offered only with lightweight titanium rails. However, due to popular demand, since 2008 we also offer the Swift Chrome, with traditional steel underpinnings, finished to our usual high standards with bright polished chromium plate.\n     <br>\n     <br>This saddle is handmade in England and is guaranteed for 2 years from the date of purchase.\n    </div> \n    <div class=\"npp_tab_content\"></div> \n    <div class=\"npp_tab_content\"> \n     <meta charset=\"utf-8\"> \n     <div class=\"tab-section\"> \n      <div class=\"tab_accordion_info_block\"> \n       <div class=\"npp_tab_container\"> \n        <div> \n         <div id=\"tab2\" class=\"npp_tab_content\"> \n          <div class=\"npp-features-delivery npp-features-3col\"> \n           <div class=\"npp-info-box\"> \n            <p>TECHNICAL INFORMATION</p> \n            <ul> \n             <li> <span>&nbsp;</span><span>LENGTH:</span><span>&nbsp;</span>272 mm</li> \n             <li> <span>&nbsp;</span><span>WIDTH:</span><span>&nbsp;</span>150 mm</li> \n             <li> <span>&nbsp;</span><span>HEIGHT:</span><span>&nbsp;</span>72 mm</li> \n             <li> <span>&nbsp;</span><span>WEIGHT:</span><span>&nbsp;</span>510 gr</li> \n            </ul> \n           </div> \n          </div> <span>&nbsp;</span> \n          <div class=\"npp-features-delivery npp-features-3col\"> \n           <div class=\"npp-info-box\"> \n            <p>MATERIAL</p> \n            <ul> \n             <li> <span>&nbsp;</span>VEGETABLE TAN LEATHER TOP</li> \n             <li> <span>&nbsp;</span>STEEL RAILS</li> \n             <li> <span>&nbsp;</span>HAND HAMMERED COPPER RIVETS</li> \n             <li> <span>&nbsp;</span>MADE IN ENGLAND</li> \n            </ul> \n           </div> \n          </div> <span>&nbsp;</span> \n          <div class=\"npp-features-delivery npp-features-3col\"> \n           <div class=\"npp-info-box\"> \n            <p>CARE INFORMATION</p> \n            <ul> \n             <li> <span>&nbsp;</span>A new saddle should be treated with Brooks Proofide Leather Dressing to help assist the \"breaking-in\" process.
